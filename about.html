<p id = "bio"> My name is Usra Attalla, and I am a Muslim-American female. Growing up as a Muslim girl, I didn't know many other women who dressed modestly. When I started wearing hijab, I had to undergo my own journey to find styles that were both fashionable and modest. I had to figure out what to wear on a daily basis, and especially what to wear on occasions, where there aren't many modest options in stores. After attending Rutgers, I began to meet other women who also dressed modestly and had a great sense of style. This made me realize that there must be other women out there who had a similar experience, and so I decided to create this blog. </p>
